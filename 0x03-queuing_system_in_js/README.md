## Queuing System in JavaScript

## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating a queuing system using Redis, Node.js, and Kue. You will build a basic back-end system that interacts with Redis to handle queuing and process jobs using Kue. The project demonstrates how Redis is used for simple key-value operations and queue management, utilizing asynchronous operations in Node.js and ES6.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Run and configure a Redis server locally.
- Perform basic Redis operations such as setting and retrieving keys using Node.js.
- Integrate Redis with Node.js for queue management.
- Handle asynchronous operations in Node.js using Promises and callbacks.
- Build a simple Express application that interacts with Redis for storing hash values and managing queues.
- Implement a Redis-based job queue using Kue for real-time job processing.

## Project Structure
- package.json: Handles the project dependencies.
1. .babelrc: Configuration file for Babel, enabling ES6 features.
2. dump.rdb: Redis dump file for testing.
3. src folder: Contains Redis server-related files.
## Setup and Installation
- Install Redis: Download and install Redis using the commands:
$ wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-6.0.10.tar.gz
$ tar xzf redis-6.0.10.tar.gz
$ cd redis-6.0.10
$ make
- Start Redis in the background:
$ src/redis-server &
- Check Redis Installation: Ensure Redis is working by running:
$ src/redis-cli ping
PONG
- Install Node Modules: Run the following command to install all the necessary packages:
$ npm install
