## 0x00.Pagination
## Pagination Project
Welcome to the Pagination Project! This project focuses on implementing various pagination techniques for efficiently handling large datasets in a back-end server. The goal is to master pagination methods and ensure data retrieval is both accurate and efficient.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
1. Paginate a Dataset with Simple Page and Page Size Parameters: Implement basic pagination using page and page_size parameters.
2. Paginate with Hypermedia Metadata: Use hypermedia to provide additional navigation information in your paginated responses.
3. Paginate in a Deletion-Resilient Manner: Ensure pagination remains accurate even if items are deleted from the dataset.

## Resources
- REST API Design: Pagination
- HATEOAS (Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State)
